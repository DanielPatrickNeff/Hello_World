# Hello_World
Noob trying to learn
I'm an old dog trying to learn new tricks.  I've always been interested in programming, but have not dedicated any real time to it since good old QBasic. LOL!  I am interested in learning Python with a focus on data science.   
For many years I sprayed automotive paints and restored old cars, but unfortunately it caught up with me and damaged my lungs(Yes I wore proper PPE and it still got me).  I developed an allergy to a chemical in automotive paints called Isocyanate.  The doctors say that I should never paint again.  It is disappointing because I enjoyed my work...and my health...it took years to learn to paint well and the skill has now been yanked away from me.  
I am currently out of work and trying to reinvent myself. SO:
print("Hello \nWorld!")
